# search-index-pwa-basics
Will contain two main things:
* A Service worker and a shared worker to help create PWAs based on search-index
* Opinionated code to help create search solutions easier

For the last part: `Search-index` is not an opinionated search engine library. It consists of all the small parts you can use to build highly different search engines or search solutions. `Search-index-pwa-basics` is making more assumptions on what developers want to do and makes those tasks easier.

## Functions to be

### service worker
* [ ] Index an array of objects
* [ ] Delete an index
* [ ] Export an index
* [ ] Status communication to application

### shared worker
* [ ] Query search engine (OR)
* [ ] Query search engine (AND)
* [ ] Query suggestion
* [ ] Show filters
* [ ] Filter on filters

Ideas, question and PR's are more than welcome =)
